# Calculator

## Exercise
Coding exercise to create an interface to calculate equations with a single operator. Like a basic desk calculator it should:

• have buttons for numbers 0-9 and the 4 operators
• a textbox for seeing what numbers and operators have been input
• an equals button to calculate the current equation
• a list of previously run calculations and their results
• be fully usable with a keyboard and ideally usable with a sceenreader.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project used the following repository as a starting point https://github.com/niinpatel/calculator-react. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
